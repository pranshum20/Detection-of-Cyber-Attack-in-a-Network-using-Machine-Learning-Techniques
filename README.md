This project is centered around the detection of cyber attacks within a network by employing advanced machine learning techniques on network flow data. The primary goal is to develop a system capable of accurately identifying and classifying potential cyber threats, thereby enhancing the security infrastructure of the network. To achieve this, the dataset underwent comprehensive preprocessing, which included handling missing values, standardizing features, and eliminating low-variance attributes using methods such as VarianceThreshold. Feature scaling was applied through StandardScaler to normalize the data, a critical step for algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM) that are particularly sensitive to feature scales.

Several machine learning models were selected and rigorously trained to assess their effectiveness in cyber attack detection. Logistic Regression (LR) stood out as the top-performing model, achieving an impressive accuracy of 95.13%, demonstrating a strong balance between precision and recall. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) also delivered robust performance with an accuracy of 94.04%, underscoring its ability to effectively separate different classes within the data. On the other hand, the Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) model, with an accuracy of 80.78%, was less effective, likely due to its inherent assumption of feature independence, which might not align with the characteristics of this particular dataset.

The evaluation process included analyzing accuracy scores and confusion matrices for each model, which provided deeper insights into their performance. The high accuracy of the Logistic Regression and SVM models suggests that the dataset is well-balanced and particularly well-suited to these techniques. In contrast, the lower performance of the Gaussian Naive Bayes model highlights its limitations in this context, possibly indicating the need for more sophisticated or different approaches for feature handling.

In conclusion, the results of this project indicate that both Logistic Regression and SVM are highly effective in detecting cyber attacks in this network dataset. The strong performance of these models suggests they are well-suited for this task. Looking forward, future work could involve further tuning of model hyperparameters, exploring additional machine learning models, and implementing strategies to better manage any potential data imbalances, all aimed at further enhancing the accuracy and robustness of cyber attack detection in networks.
